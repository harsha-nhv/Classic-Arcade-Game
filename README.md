#### How to play the game

Initially, the game loads with the player on the grass tiles. The goal of the game is to reach the water tiles
without hitting the bugs.

The Player can move up, down, left and right with the help of the arrow keys within the board.

If the player comes in contact with the bug, the game gets reloaded and the player has to start from the first.
A popup window is opened whenever the player loses.

If the player successfully makes to the water by avoiding the bugs, he has won the game and popup window is opened with greeting the player. The game is reloaded after closing the window and continues.

The Player and Enemy classes are implemented in the app.js file using ES6.
